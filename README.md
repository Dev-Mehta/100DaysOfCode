# Data Structures and Algorithms Daily Practice
> This is just my archive repository where I practice coding custom vector classes and other more data structure using this [study plan](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university).

## Timeline
- ### Day 1 - Arrays
Implement an automatically resizing vector in :
 - [ ] C++
 - [ ] Java
 - [ ] Python

## Data Structures

- ### Arrays
    - Implement an automatically resizing vector.
    - [ ] Implement a vector (mutable array with automatic resizing):
        - [x] size() - number of items
        - [x] capacity() - number of items it can hold
        - [x] is_empty()
        - [x] at(index) - returns item at given index, blows up if index out of bounds
        - [x] push(item)
        - [ ] insert(index, item) - inserts item at index, shifts that index's value and trailing elements to the right
        - [ ] prepend(item) - can use insert above at index 0
        - [x] pop() - remove from end, return value
        - [ ] delete(index) - delete item at index, shifting all trailing elements left
        - [ ] remove(item) - looks for value and removes index holding it (even if in multiple places)
        - [ ] find(item) - looks for value and returns first index with that value, -1 if not found
        - [ ] resize(new_capacity) // private function
            - when you reach capacity, resize to double the size
            - when popping an item, if size is 1/4 of capacity, resize to half
    - [ ] Time
        - O(1) to add/remove at end (amortized for allocations for more space), index, or update
        - O(n) to insert/remove elsewhere
    - [ ] Space
        - contiguous in memory, so proximity helps performance
        - space needed = (array capacity, which is >= n) * size of item, but even if 2n, still O(n)
